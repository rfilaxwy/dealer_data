> Simple UI with two buttons, one to get the car dealer data, one to post the data. Upon click the get button, a sample of the recieved data is shown, and the post button is enabled.
> There is a simple node backend accepting a get and a post. 

> In this hypothetical program one server is used for getting and posting the data. I took for granted that in real world scenario this would likely be 
> a client package of data that is sent and my need cleaning before being added to the db.
